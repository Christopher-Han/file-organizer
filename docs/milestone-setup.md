# Milestone Notes: Setup & Infrastructure

This milestone establishes the foundational scaffolding for the Agentic File Organizer.

## Outcomes
- Project plan recorded for future reference.
- Python package structure initialized (`organizer` package with CLI, runtime, and server modules).
- Configuration loader implemented to resolve storage paths and create required directories.
- CLI `organizer init` command ensures configuration directories are created and visible.
- Pytest configuration and a smoke test validate the configuration loader.

## Next Steps
- Implement filesystem scanning and indexing tools.
- Flesh out MCP server scaffolding and shared context objects.
- Expand CLI commands to cover review, search, and rollback flows.
