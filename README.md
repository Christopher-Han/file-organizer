# Agentic File Organizer

This repository contains the implementation of an MCP-powered agent that organizes files safely and
intelligently. The project roadmap, including milestones and major tasks, is documented in
[`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md).

## Getting Started

The codebase targets Python 3.11+. To set up the project locally:

```bash
conda create -n organizer python=3.11
conda activate organizer
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Additional documentation for each milestone will be recorded in the `docs/` directory as the project
progresses.
